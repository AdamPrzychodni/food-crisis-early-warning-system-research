# **Research Design: An Implementation Plan**

## Introduction and Objective

This document operationalizes the **Research Model** by providing a detailed implementation plan for the Food Crisis Early Warning System. The objective is to translate the **six-stage conceptual framework** into a concrete set of data processing steps, model selections, and analytical techniques. This research design will serve as the direct blueprint for the accompanying Jupyter Notebooks, ensuring that the implementation is rigorous, reproducible, and directly aligned with the project's goals.

## Foundational Work: EDA & Preprocessing

### **Stage 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Preprocessing**

* **Associated Notebook:** `01_EDA.ipynb`, `02_data_preprocessing.ipynb`
* **Objective:** To understand the data's fundamental properties and to perform initial text cleaning.
* **Implementation:**
    * **EDA:** All data files will be loaded into `pandas` DataFrames. A comprehensive analysis will be performed to inspect data structures, check for missing values, and visualize key distributions, including time-series plots of article volume and geospatial distributions.
    * **Preprocessing:** A standardized function will be applied to clean the text by removing HTML tags, URLs, and extra whitespace. A custom regular expression will then be used to segment the cleaned text into sentences.

## Implementation of the Modeling Pipeline

### **Stage 2: Feature Engineering (Semantic Filtering)**

* **Associated Notebook:** `03_feature_engineering.ipynb`
* **Objective:** To intelligently reduce the dataset size by pre-selecting the most relevant articles for the computationally intensive classification stage.
* **Model:** A lightweight, multilingual sentence-embedding model, `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`, from the `SentenceTransformer` library.
* **Execution:** All article bodies and the 167 risk factors will be encoded into a shared vector space. A high-speed `util.semantic_search` will identify articles with a semantic similarity score above a threshold of **0.25**, creating a smaller, high-relevance corpus.

### **Stage 3: Multilingual Risk Factor Extraction**

* **Associated Notebook:** `04_risk_factor_extraction.ipynb` (previously `03_model_selection.ipynb`)
* **Objective:** To perform a deep analysis on the filtered articles to extract specific risk factor mentions.
* **Model:** The **`MoritzLaurer/mDeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-xnli`** model, a state-of-the-art model for zero-shot classification, implemented via the Hugging Face `transformers` library.
* **Execution:** Sentences from the filtered articles will be processed in batches. The model will classify sentences against the 167 risk factors, requiring a confidence threshold of **0.80** for a positive classification.
* **Output:** A `pandas` DataFrame with columns: `article_id`, `date`, `sentence_text`, `risk_factor`, and `confidence_score`.

### **Stage 4: Geospatial Intelligence and Hotspot Identification**

* **Objective:** To link textual risk signals to specific geographic districts and identify statistically significant spatial clusters.
* **Model & Libraries:** `spaCy`'s `xx_ent_wiki_sm` model for Geographic Named Entity Recognition (GNER), along with `geopandas` and `esda` for analysis.
* **Execution:** `GPE` entities will be extracted from articles and resolved against location dictionaries. The Getis-Ord Gi\* statistic will then be calculated on the geolocated risk counts to identify and visualize hotspots.

### **Stage 5: Hierarchical Risk Index Construction**

* **Objective:** To aggregate the discrete risk events into a continuous, quantitative time-series metric for monitoring.
* **Implementation (`pandas`):**
    * **Aggregation:** Data will be grouped by `date` and `district_key` to get daily raw counts of risk factors.
    * **Normalization:** Raw counts will be normalized by the total article count per district per day.
    * **Index Calculation:** Thematic and Composite Risk Indices (CRI) will be calculated by averaging the normalized scores based on category mappings.

### **Stage 6: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection**

* **Objective:** To automatically flag unusual spikes in risk, demonstrating the system's utility as an early warning tool.
* **Algorithm:** A **moving average-based z-score** method.
* **Implementation:** A 7-day rolling window will be used to calculate the moving average and standard deviation for each district's CRI. An anomaly will be flagged if the **z-score is greater than 2.0**. A qualitative validation function will retrieve news headlines corresponding to any alert.
