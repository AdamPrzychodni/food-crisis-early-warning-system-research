## Stage 1: Multilingual News Processing and Geographic Filtering

### Objective  
Develop a scalable pipeline for processing 172K multilingual news articles with geographic relevance filtering to focus computational resources on crisis-relevant content.

### Technical Approach
- **Two-Stage Geographic Filtering:**
  1. **Keyword Pre-filtering:** Regex-based filtering using 918 location aliases for computational efficiency (94.2% article retention)
  2. **NER Validation:** WikiNeuRaL multilingual model for precise location entity recognition and validation
- **Text Preprocessing:** HTML/URL removal, multilingual sentence tokenization using punctuation pattern recognition for Arabic and English
- **Quality Control:** Sentence length filtering (minimum 3-4 words) to eliminate noise and improve downstream model performance

### Model Selection Rationale
- **WikiNeuRaL Multilingual NER:** Chosen for its demonstrated performance on both Arabic and English location entities
- **Balanced Filtering Strategy:** Combines computational efficiency (keyword pre-filtering) with precision (NER validation)

## Stage 2: Risk Factor Extraction Using Advanced NLP

### Objective
Transform unstructured news sentences into structured risk factor mentions using state-of-the-art zero-shot classification and semantic similarity techniques.

### Methodological Innovation
- **Semantic Pre-filtering:** `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2` sentence embeddings to identify sentences semantically similar to risk factors (0.7 similarity threshold)
- **Zero-shot Classification:** `MoritzLaurer/deberta-v3-xsmall-zeroshot-v1.1-all-33` for precise risk factor classification (0.95 confidence threshold)
- **Quality Refinement:** Hierarchical filtering retaining highest-confidence predictions per sentence

### Computational Constraints and Trade-offs
Due to computational limitations, aggressive filtering parameters prioritize precision over recall:
- High similarity threshold (0.7) reduces false positives but may miss subtle risk expressions
- Very high confidence threshold (0.95) ensures quality but potentially eliminates valid but uncertain classifications
- Results: 3.9M sentences → 12.8K relevant sentences → 2.2K high-confidence risk mentions

### Future Enhancement Path
**Custom Model Development:** Replace generic models with domain-specific trained models:
1. **Food Security Binary Classifier:** BERT-based model trained on humanitarian texts to identify food security-related content
2. **Multi-label Risk Classifier:** Specialized model for the 167-factor taxonomy using hierarchical classification

## Stage 3: Hierarchical Geotagging and Location Resolution

### Objective
Map identified risk mentions to specific administrative boundaries using sophisticated location resolution logic that maximizes geographic precision.

### Technical Implementation
- **Dual-Level NER Processing:** Extract locations from both individual sentences and full article context
- **Hierarchical Resolution Logic:**
  1. Specific sentence locations (administrative level >2) - highest priority
  2. Any sentence locations - medium priority  
  3. Specific article locations - low priority
  4. Any article locations - fallback
- **Location Normalization:** Comprehensive gazetteer matching against 918 location aliases covering country through district levels

### Quality Assurance
- **Sentence Length Filtering:** Remove sentences <4 words to improve NER accuracy
- **Multi-source Validation:** Cross-reference against both English and Arabic location dictionaries
- **Coverage Analysis:** Track geographic distribution to identify potential bias or gaps

### Expected Output
1,050 validated risk-location pairs with hierarchical confidence scoring

## Stage 4: Risk Index Construction and Normalization

### Objective
Transform discrete risk mentions into continuous, comparable risk indices that control for media coverage bias and enable temporal trend analysis.

### Methodological Framework
- **Temporal Aggregation:** Daily risk counts by location and thematic cluster (13 clusters: conflict, humanitarian aid, food crisis, etc.)
- **Normalization Strategy:** Divide risk counts by daily article publication volume to control for media attention bias
- **Index Types:**
  - **Thematic Risk Indices:** Cluster-specific scores for detailed analysis
  - **Composite Risk Index (CRI):** Location-level average across all themes for overall assessment

### Statistical Approach
- **Data Structure:** 765 daily records across 76 locations over 32 days (June-July 2024)
- **Risk Score Range:** 0.000206 to 0.001618 (Gaza showing highest sustained risk)
- **Temporal Granularity:** Daily resolution enabling trend analysis and early warning capability

### Innovation Elements
- **Media Bias Control:** Novel normalization approach addressing systematic media coverage differences
- **Multi-dimensional Assessment:** Separate thematic and composite indices for different analytical purposes

## Stage 5: Geospatial Visualization and Risk Mapping

### Objective
Create comprehensive choropleth maps using administrative boundaries to visualize spatial risk patterns and support humanitarian decision-making.

### Technical Implementation
- **Boundary Data:** GADM administrative level 2 shapefiles for 5 Mashriq countries (260 total features)
- **Location Mapping:** Sophisticated name resolution matching risk data to administrative units
- **Visualization Suite:**
  1. Mean risk distribution maps
  2. Maximum risk threshold maps  
  3. Log-scaled visualizations for outlier analysis
  4. Data coverage assessment maps
  5. Risk variability (standard deviation) maps

### Geographic Analysis Findings
- Successfully mapped 15 administrative units with risk data
- Identified Gaza, Iraq, and Syria as highest-risk regions
- Revealed geographic coverage limitations for improvement targeting

## Stage 6: Model Validation Against Authoritative Sources

### Objective
Validate model predictions against established humanitarian assessments to quantify system reliability and identify improvement opportunities.

### Validation Framework
- **Ground Truth Sources:** IPC Famine Review Committee, WFP Country Briefs, FEWS NET assessments for July 2024
- **Comparison Methodology:** Convert continuous risk indices to IPC phase classifications (1-5 scale) using percentile-based categorization
- **Validation Metrics:**
  - Phase error (absolute difference between predicted and actual IPC phases)
  - Direction accuracy (crisis vs non-crisis classification)
  - Risk alignment scores (normalized accuracy measures)

### Performance Results
- **Direction Accuracy:** 66.7% for crisis vs non-crisis distinction
- **Mean Phase Error:** 0.83 IPC phases
- **Key Success:** Correctly identified Gaza famine conditions as highest risk
- **Coverage:** Validated across 6 locations with varying evidence strength levels

### Critical Assessment
**Strengths:**
- Successfully identifies extreme crisis conditions (Gaza famine)
- Reasonable directional accuracy for crisis classification  
- Systematic validation against authoritative sources

**Limitations:**
- Phase-level precision requires improvement
- Limited geographic validation coverage
- Potential over-reliance on explicit risk language
